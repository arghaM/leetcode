this algo works as the question already saying there would always be a pick element. and as there
is a peak element present , there would be an increasing sub sequence- that property binary search is
exploting to find the answer.

-There's guaranteed existence of a peak.
-Which guarantees slope transitions (↑ then ↓).
-Which makes it possible to use binary search by checking the direction of the slope.
